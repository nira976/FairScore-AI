# 💳 FairScore AI

An Explainable Credit Risk Assessment Platform for Gig Economy Workers using Machine Learning and Explainable AI.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional credit scoring systems often fail to assess gig workers fairly due to irregular income patterns and limited credit history.

FairScore AI addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict credit risk using alternative financial and behavioral indicators relevant to gig economy workers.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts credit risk categories:
  - 🟢 Low Risk
  - 🟡 Moderate Risk
  - 🔴 High Risk

- Interactive Streamlit dashboard

- Explainable AI using SHAP

- Confidence score for each prediction

- Premium user interface with real-time assessment

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Accuracy | 81% |
| Model | XGBoost |
| Classes | High Risk, Moderate Risk, Low Risk |

---

## 🧠 Explainability

The project incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide transparency into model predictions.

Top influencing factors include:

- EMI Defaults
- Existing Debt Ratio
- Emergency Fund Months
- Bill Payment Score
- Savings Ratio

This allows users to understand why a specific risk category was assigned.
